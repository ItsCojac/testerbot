Flashloan Arbitrage Bot UI

The Flashloan Arbitrage Bot UI allows you to view the best arbitrage opportunities and execute trades.
Prerequisites

    The Flashloan Arbitrage Bot must be running and accessible.
    The ui directory must be served through a web server (e.g. Apache, Nginx, etc.).

Usage

    Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where the ui directory is served (e.g. http://localhost/ui/index.html).
    If you haven't already, login with your API key and private key.
    View the list of best arbitrage opportunities in the table.
    To execute an arbitrage trade, click the "Execute" button for the corresponding opportunity and enter the amount to trade in the prompt.
    If the trade is successful, an alert will be displayed. Otherwise, an alert with the error message will be displayed.

Security considerations

    Make sure to only serve the ui directory through a secure connection (e.g. HTTPS) to protect against Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
    Always keep your API key and private key secret and never share them with anyone.
    Use a strong and unique password for your account to prevent unauthorized access.
    Monitor your account activity regularly and report any suspicious activity immediately.
